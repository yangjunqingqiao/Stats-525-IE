#Introduction
###Read data, convert factor to numeric
- Here is the first few lines of the birds data
```{r,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(car)

bird=read.table("http://www.stat.ucla.edu/projects/datasets/birds.dat",header=TRUE,sep=",",fill=TRUE)

for(x in 2:9){
  bird[,x] = as.numeric(as.character(bird[,x]))
}

head(bird)
```
- This data is from a study done on the number of breeding pairs of birds in 40 locations around the American Pacific coastline as well as closer inland. Taken during the spring of 1994, the sites were all around 5 hetacres in size and situated in relativly homogenous habitats. The number breeding pairs of bird species was counted by sight and by analyzing sound recordings. The variables are defined by the researchers as follows:

    - `SITE`: The site in which the data was taken
    - `Elevation`: The height of the site in meters above sea level.
    - `Profile.Area`: Roughly, a measure of the total amount of foliage at a site. Technically, this number is obtained by plotting vegetation density versus height above ground and taking the total area under the graph. The units, however, are not typical area units, as vegetation density is the reciprocal of a distance; the units are specially designed to measure profile area, and are called f.p. units (foliage profile units).
    - `Height`: Roughly, the height of the top of the forest canopy. Technically, the height above which horizontal distance to semi-obscurity exceeds 30 meters(a height from which line of sight is over 30 meters). Given in meters.
    - `Half.height`: Roughly, the height that divides total foliage in two: half the forest is above it, and half below. Technically, the median of the graph of vegetation density versus height. Given in meters.
    - `Latitude`: The latitude of the site. Given in degrees.
    - `Longitude`: The longitude of the site. Given in degrees.
    - `No..Species`: The number of different species of breeding bird pairs.
    - `Total.density`: A measure of the bird population density, defined as the number of pairs of birds per hectare.

- There is data missing from the `Elevation`, `Profile.Area`, `Heigh`t, and `Half.height` variables. The missing points of elevation seem to be random. However, the missing data points for `Profile.Area`, `Height`, and `Half.height` follow the following conditions:
    - A site missing its `Half.height` will also not have its `Profile area` and vice versa. 
    - If a site is missing its `Height` variable, it will also be missing its `Profile.Area` and `Half.height` variables. 
    - A likely explanation for this is that `Profile.Area` is related in some way to `Half.height`, according to the description of the variables, `Half.height` and `Profile.Area` are both calculated from vegetation density with respect to height. So it would also make sense that in the cases where `Height` was not calculatable that the data points for `Profile.Area` and `Half.height` are missing as well. We check our theory by plotting `Profile.Area` vs `Height`, `Half.height` vs `Height`, and `Half.height` vs `Profile.Area`. Our tests for these relationships is in a later section of our report.

\newpage
- It is usefull to see where exactly the sites are so here is a picture of the rough locations of all the sites sampled from in this data.

#Questions
- The following are questions posed by the researchers who collected this data

###(a) Are there more species of birds in denser forests?
- In other words, what is the relationship between `No..Species` and `Profile.Area`?
- A scatterplot is a good place to start `No..Species` and `Profile.Area`
```{r,echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
scatterplot(No..Species~Profile.Area,data=bird,smoother=FALSE)
```

- In the figure above, the scatter points appear to form a very wide oval shape which is tilted upward. This indicates that a positive correlation may exist between species of birds and the density of forests, although the variance is quite large.
- Our next step is checking a residual plot to see if it follows a null distribution
```{r,echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
residualPlot(lm(No..Species~Profile.Area,data=bird),ylab="Residual of No...Species",xlab="Profile.Area")
```
- The plot strongly suggests a null distribution and thus it seems our assumption that the number of species of birds is positively correlated with the profile area of the forest is justified.

###(b) Are birds concentrated more densely in areas where vegetation is more dense?
- This question concerns the relationship between `Total.density` and `Profile.Area`
- We certainly expect it to be because we have shown earlier that we believe `Total.density` and `No..Species` to be correlated and so since we believe that `No..Species` and `Profile.Area` are correlated we have no reason to think that `Total.Density` and `Profile.Area` are not.
```{r,echo=FALSE}
scatterplot(Total.density~Profile.Area,data=bird,smoother=FALSE)
```

- This scatterplot looks very similar to our previous scatterplot of `No..Species` vs `Profile.Area` except for one point which deviates from our model which we did not see in our other plot. 
```{r,echo=FALSE}
residualPlot(lm(Total.density~Profile.Area,data=bird),ylab="Residual of Total.density",xlab="Profile.Area")
```
- Taking a look at the residual plot we see that again it looks to be a null plot with the exception of one point. Topanga state park in California seems to have an unusually high density of birds with respect to the Profile.Area that it was taken in.
- There are several ways to explain the behavior of this particular point. It could be due to natural variation in sampling or it could be an incorrectly recorded point of data. However, for either of these cases it would not change our conclusion that `Total.density` is in fact correlated with `Profile.Area`.

###(c) Is there more diversity in locations at higher latitudes, or lower latitudes?
- This question pertains to the relationship between `No..Species` and `Latitude`
```{r,echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
scatterplot(No..Species~Latitude,data=bird,smoother=FALSE)
```
- In the following scatterplot we do not see anything that would indicate any relationship between `Latitude` and `No..Species`. This result intuitively makes sense because if we believe climate to be the largest determining factor of the behaviour of bird species, looking at the spread of data points we can see that the different locations share similar climates and so what we see is likely normal variation of locations of differing latitude which do not influence the number of species of thier location.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
residualPlot(lm(No..Species ~ Latitude, data=bird), ylab = "Residual of No..Species",xlab = "Latitude")
```
- The residual plot appears to follow a null distribution but since our data is collected so closely on a global scale we are hesitant to make any conclusions of the true relationship between `No..Species` and `Latitude`.


###(d) Which technical measure of vegetation structure is the best predictor of the number of bird species in a forest.
- This question asks which parameter from `Profile.Area`, `Height` and `Half.height` we believe could best predict `No..Species`
```{r,echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
scatterplotMatrix( ~ Profile.Area + Height + Half.height + No..Species, data = bird, smoother=FALSE)
```
- From the scatterplot alone it is difficult to see which variable is most suited to estimate our response variables. We may instead perform an f test on several different models to isolate the effects of adding in each variable to our model. From the results of those f tests we may determine the most suitable variable to estimate our responses.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
residualPlot(lm(No..Species ~ Profile.Area + Height + Half.height, data = bird), ylab = "Residuals of No..Species")
```
- From this residual plot we see that not only does the plot follow the distribution of a null plot, our model plotted against the residuals also displays a line close to 0. This indicates that the variances of our all values of our estimates are all roughly equivalent.
-  It is clear that a model which uses all three estimators will be relativly accurate as shown by the residual plot below and if possible, it will be better to obtain all three values if one wishes to estimate the density and variety of birds in a certain forest.

#Determining the useful parameters
- F-test:
    - Large p-value $\to$ $H_0$ $\to$ new variable is non-significant
    - Small p-value $\to$ $H_1$ $\to$ new variable is significant
- Original model 1:
```
M1: No..Species ~ Elevation + Profile.Area + Height + Half.height + Latitude + Longitude
```
$$\mbox{No..Species} \sim \mbox{Elevation}+\mbox{Profile.Area}+\mbox{Height}+\mbox{Half.height}+\mbox{Latitude}+\mbox{Longitude}$$
- Original model 2:
```
M2: Total.density ~ Elevation + Profile.Area + Height + Half.height + Latitude + Longitude
```
$$\mbox{Total.density} \sim \mbox{Elevation}+\mbox{Profile.Area}+\mbox{Height}+\mbox{Half.height}+\mbox{Latitude}+\mbox{Longitude}$$

###1. Plot scatterplot matrix
```{r,echo=FALSE}
scatterplotMatrix( ~ Elevation + Profile.Area + Height + Half.height + Latitude + Longitude + No..Species + Total.density, data = bird, smoother=FALSE)
```

- The final goal of this study is to find the relationship between the first 6 parameters and the last 2 parameters. 
- We'll analysis the relationship between the last 2 parameters first to see if they could convert to each other.
- Then we'll analysis each of the first 6 parameters with either `No..Species` or `Total.density`.

###2. Relationship between `Profile.Area`, `Height` and `Half.height`
#####We analyse those three variables because they all related to vegetation.
```{r,echo=FALSE}
scatterplotMatrix( ~ Profile.Area + Height + Half.height, data=bird, smoother=FALSE)
```

- `Profile.Area` and `Height`
```{r,echo=FALSE}
ols_profile_vs_height = lm(Profile.Area ~ Height, data = bird, na.action = na.exclude)
profile_vs_height=ggplot(bird,aes(x=Height,y=Profile.Area))
profile_vs_height + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method = "lm", col ="red", fullrange=TRUE)
summary(ols_profile_vs_height)
```

- `Half.height` and `Height`
```{r,echo=FALSE}
ols_half_vs_height = lm(Half.height ~ Height, data=bird, na.action=na.exclude)
half_vs_height = ggplot(bird, aes(x = Height, y = Half.height))
half_vs_height +geom_point() + stat_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red", fullrange=TRUE)
summary(ols_half_vs_height)
```

- `Half.height` and `Profile.Area`
```{r,echo=FALSE}
ols_half_vs_profile = lm(Half.height ~ Profile.Area,data = bird, na.action = na.exclude)
half_vs_profile = ggplot(bird, aes(x = Profile.Area,y = Half.height))
half_vs_profile + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red", fullrange=TRUE)
summary(ols_half_vs_profile)
```

###3. Relationship between `No..Species` and `Total.density`
#####Those two variables are two $y$s.
```{r,echo=FALSE}
scatterplotMatrix(~No..Species+Total.density,data=bird,smoother=FALSE)
```

- The following is added variable plot
```{r,echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
residualPlot(lm(No..Species~Total.density,data=bird),ylab="Residual of No..Species",xlab="Total.density")
```

- **CONCLUSIONS OF PART 3**

###4. Remove `Latitude` and `Longitude`

- For the reasons mentioned above, since the data are collected only in California and not globally, we cannot make any solid conclusions of the relationship between `Latitude` and `Longitude` versus `No..Species` and `Total.density`. Thus we have decided to remove them from our models.

###5. Either Transform or Remove `Elevation`
```{r,echo=FALSE}
scatterplotMatrix(~Elevation+No..Species+Total.density,data=bird,smoother=FALSE)
```
- Elevation as it currently is 

- **F-test**
###6. Models
$$y_1=\mbox{No..Species}$$
$$y_2=\mbox{Total.density}$$
$$x_1=\mbox{Profile.Area}$$
$$x_2=\mbox{Height}$$
$$x_3=\mbox{Half.height}$$
```
M1: No..Species~Profile.Area+Height+Half.height
```
$$y_1=\beta_{10}+\beta_{11}x_1+\beta_{12}x_2+\beta_{13}x_3$$
```
M2: Total.density~Profile.Area+Height+Half.height
```
$$y_2=\beta_{20}+\beta_{21}x_1+\beta_{22}x_2+\beta_{23}x_3$$
#Conclusion
- So far, we have concluded that out of all the estimators we were given, `Half.height`, `Profile.Area`, and `Height` are the best estimators for `No..Species` as well as `Total.Density`. We are still working on seeing if any transformation will make `Elevation` a suitable estimator as well as seeing if a linear model with respect to heights and vegetation density is a reasonable model.
